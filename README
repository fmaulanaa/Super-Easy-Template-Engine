Super Easy Templates
--------------------

This template engine with language support was created to ease the
life of numerous web developers that didn't want to delegate to the
server (PHP, Ruby, Python, etc) the tedious task of translating
all the pages of a website.

How to install this engine
--------------------------

Just copy all the directory structure into the final directory exp-
osed to the web server.

In the "index.html" file set the baseUrl variable to the adequate 
situation.

Open the browser with the URL to the code, and you should see a
basic screen displaying some explanatory text and two languages
options, english and spanish.

How to make this work
---------------------

This template engine consist in three easy steps:

1. Set the Mustache templates acording to your needs. Look at this
   url if you need more help:

   http://mustache.github.com/

   In this template, whenever you are calling to the proper transla-
   ted elements, you need to call them by the prefix "template_" :

   {{template_title}}

2. Include the proper Locale in the /locales directory with the same
   template as the two provided with this library (en, es).

3. Per template name, include the proper tags in the locale file,
   so, if you are calling for example in the template for the tag:

   {{template_change_language}}

   This is reflected in the locales file:

   "change_language": "Change your languange."

   Inside the section under the name of the template:

   "templateName.mustache": {
     "change_language": "Change your language"
   }

4. And create the proper View / Controller / Manager that handles
   the information you are displaying in this particular template.
